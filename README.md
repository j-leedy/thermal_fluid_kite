## Kite Modeling and Design w/ Matlab
A project for Introduction to Thermal-Fluid Systems at Olin College of Engineering involving the design of a simple kite. 
Applies fluid dynamics skills (inc drag, lift) to model the performance of the kite. My particular kite is a simple diamond configuration, 
and in modeling, I opted to fix my angle of attack and paramterize the location of the kite's bridle point.

Above is a graphical representation of a kite bridle point, pulled from the matlab script used for calculations and visualizations. The `figures`
path includes additional visulizations of the kite and parameter sweeps used in the modeling process. The primary modeling script and its 
dependencies can be found in `matlab_scripts`, and supplementary hand-written calculations live in `hand calcs`. A detailed write up of my kite 
and model can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13JxFMfeyaUTt6XIgRJeR9Lb_5vWK1OGwoiMMcLAkbmY/edit?usp=sharing).
